# YamlConfiguration
A Java library that makes it easier to use YAML files for configuration!

## Why?
I felt that the current YAML libraries just can't get the job done, or are very confusing (to me) to implement. A lot of them want to serialize/de-serialize objects, but that's not what the goal of this project is for.

The goal of this project is to make YAML files easier to use for configurative purposes.
